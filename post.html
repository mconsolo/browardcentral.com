There are a variety of units in the Plaza Del Sol Condominiums. 1 bedroom, 2 bedroom and 3 bedroom floor plans are all available. The complex was converted to condos in 2006 from apartments and the builder did a fantastic job. You can expect modern spacious layouts with mostly hardwood floors throughout the living room, dining room and kitchen. The bathrooms have porcelain floors and the bedrooms are done in carpet. That is unless the current owners have done some updating (not that they would need to). Granite countertops and stainless steel appliances make for a modern feel in the kitchens. All units in the builder at 2 bedroom, 2 bath. The smallest unit is 1,415 sq ft and the biggest one is 1,550 sq ft. For buying purposes the units that are closer to the top are more expensive, reason being are those units have a better view.&nbsp;</div>

<strong>Don't look any further</strong>! Looking for a condo in the Victoria Park section of Fort Lauderdale? You have just found it! La Cancha is in a great little neighborhood in north Fort Lauderdale. It is close to downtown, the beach and plenty of shopping. The Victoria Park location gets a walkscore of 66 and it is one of the safest neighborhoods in Fort Lauderdale. These condos are great for living year round or simple enough to take care of if you want to keep it as a vacation spot. Having a pool a few feet away and the beach only a couple miles down the road sounds like a good get away to me!<br />

The bigger units come in a 2/2 layout and the smaller units come in a 1/1 layout. Most owners have updated their unit with tile flooring and stainless steel appliances in the kitchen to give the home a more modern look. The master bedroom comes with a walk-in closet which is right next to the personal bathroom. Each unit comes with additional storage space so you won't need to worry about renting a storage unit for extra stuff. One of the benefits of this condominium is that you are able to rent out your unit right after you buy it. The condo association does not put a restriction on how soon your unit can be rented making this a great place to buy an investment. Rents range from $1,600 - $1,800 a month.<br />

There are a number of sites on the internet that will give you 'estimates' for what your home will sell for. These sites use public records and usually some kind of algorithm to try to produce a value for your home. These sites also publicly state their 'error rates'. That means they aren't correct, they are simply an estimate based on incomplete date. We would love to do a free comparative market analysis of your home or condo in Fort Lauderdale and let you know what could expect to get in today's market if you are considering selling. Our valuation is based on up to the day data for homes that have recently sold in the area. Our valuation is not based on a formula that relies on public records which can take months to update.

<!--Search for Homes Through the MLS: Start-->
When you are looking to find a home you want the most up to date data, right? Searching Trulia, Zillow and Realtor.com are a lot of time out of date. I know from past experiences with my home search that I would find something I liked from one of those sites. Then I would call my Realtor to ask if it was still available and sure enough the place was off the market.<br />
<br />
Go to <a href="http://mattconsolo.matrix.southfloridamls.com//" target="_blank">The South Florida Home Search</a> to find houses that reflect the MLS. That way you know the homes are still for sale when they are actually still for sale.

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <p name="stars">As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
